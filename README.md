# PiPixelProject
A Python script that creates an image using a possible 100 Million digits of pi. Uses Pillow (PIL fork).

Download the python script and install pip and Pillow from the command line, instructions can be found as below.
pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
Pillow: http://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/3.0.x/installation.html

Then run pi_pixel_project.py you have downloaded.
After a short welcome message you will be prompted to choose a pixel width and height for the canvas of your pi image.
Then the script will run itself. If you have chosen to create a large image then this may take some time.
Currently a total area of 11,111,111 pixels is possible.
Once the script has finished processing your new image will be saved to your execution directory.

Mor information about the project and a few images I have created can be found on my website: http://the-silent-partner.com/the-pi-pixel-project/

Thanks for reading, happy Pi Day!
